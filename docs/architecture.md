# In-Memory Key-Value Store Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the In-Memory Key-Value Store (KVS) project. The KVS is designed to provide fast data access and manipulation capabilities, leveraging in-memory storage for optimal performance.

## Components
The architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Server**: The entry point of the application, responsible for handling incoming requests via HTTP or gRPC. It initializes the necessary configurations and starts the server.

2. **Store**: The core component that implements the key-value storage functionality. It includes methods for storing, retrieving, and deleting data.

   - **Sharding**: The store utilizes sharding to distribute data across multiple shards, enhancing scalability and performance.
   - **Eviction**: An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache mechanism is implemented to manage memory efficiently by removing the least accessed entries.
   - **TTL Management**: A TTL (Time To Live) feature is included to automatically expire and remove data after a specified duration.

3. **API**: The application exposes an API for external interactions.

   - **HTTP Handlers**: These handle HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate functions.
   - **gRPC Services**: Provides a gRPC interface for clients to interact with the KVS.

4. **Configuration**: A dedicated module for managing application settings, including loading and validating configuration files.

5. **Versioning**: A version management component that tracks the application version and provides version information.

6. **Client**: A package that implements the client-side logic for accessing the KVS, allowing external applications to perform operations on the key-value store.

## Data Flow
1. **Client Request**: A client sends a request to the server via HTTP or gRPC.
2. **Request Handling**: The server routes the request to the appropriate handler based on the endpoint.
3. **Data Operations**: The handler interacts with the store to perform the requested operation (e.g., get, set, delete).
4. **Response**: The server sends a response back to the client with the result of the operation.

## Scalability and Performance
The architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of more shards as the data volume grows. The use of in-memory storage ensures high-speed data access, while the eviction and TTL mechanisms help manage memory usage effectively.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a robust foundation for the In-Memory Key-Value Store, enabling efficient data management and high-performance access patterns. Future enhancements may include additional features such as replication, persistence, and advanced querying capabilities.
